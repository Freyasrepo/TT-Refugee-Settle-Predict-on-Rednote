# Efficient Deep Learning for Predicting User Retention Among TikTok Refugees on Xiaohongshu

## Project Overview
This project explores the retention of TikTok refugee users on Xiaohongshu, analyzing their behavioral engagement and content adaptation strategies. We utilize deep learning techniques with a focus on efficiency to predict user retention while minimizing computational costs.

## Problem Definition
The goal is to determine which factors contribute to users remaining active on Xiaohongshu after their migration from TikTok in January 2025. This is framed as a supervised classification problem, where we predict whether a user will stay engaged in February based on their behavioral and content-related features.

## Data
### 1. Data Source
The dataset (`tt_refugee.csv`) consists of user interactions and content metadata from January and February 2025. It is publicly available on Kaggle:
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinghuawu/tiktok-refugee-migration-data)

### 2. Data Features
- **Behavioral Features:** Likes, shares, comments, collections
- **Textual Content:** Posts made by users, processed for topic modeling
- **Temporal Trends:** Daily activity variations and retention indicators

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Text Processing:** Tokenization (Jieba for Chinese), stop-word removal, TF-IDF, FastText, and DistilBERT embeddings.
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardization of behavioral features.
- **Retention Labeling:** Users active in February are labeled as retained.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Distribution of interaction features, retention trends.
- **Correlation Study:** Identifying key engagement features affecting retention.
- **Topic Modeling (NMF):** Identifying content themes linked to user retention.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
We implemented a hybrid deep learning model combining:
- **DistilBERT:** For extracting rich semantic embeddings from textual data.
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron):** For processing behavioral engagement features.
- **LSTM (Optional):** To capture temporal trends in user activity.

#### Model Architecture
- **Dense (128 neurons, ReLU) + Batch Normalization + Dropout (0.2)**
- **Dense (64 neurons, ReLU) + Batch Normalization + Dropout (0.2)**
- **Final Output Layer:** Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

#### Training Strategy
- **Optimizer:** Adam (adaptive learning rate)
- **Loss Function:** Binary cross-entropy
- **Regularization:** Dropout layers to mitigate overfitting
- **Early Stopping & Learning Rate Reduction:** Improve generalization

## Results & Discussion
- **Accuracy:** 99.38% (but misleading due to class imbalance)
- **AUC-ROC:** 0.7012 (indicating moderate predictive power)
- **Issue:** High class imbalance led to poor recall for retained users.
- **Future Work:** Addressing class imbalance through weighted loss functions or synthetic data augmentation.
